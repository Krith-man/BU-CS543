run the code are the following: ***numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, os***.


To install them under pip you need to follow the command:
> pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn os


The following lines provide you a description of how to run all the experiments of the project.

For synthetic dataset plots, run the synthetic dataset script as follows: 
> python synthetic_dataset.py

For real dataset plots, run the real dataset script as follows: 
> python real_dataset.py

For exploring Achlioptas plots, run the explore Achlioptas script as follows: 
> python explore_achlioptas.py

The real dataset OGB-Products can be found [here](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/).
All the plots will be generated under the figures folder inside sub folders with the proper naming for each experiment that was conducted.
